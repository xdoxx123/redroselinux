Yes, the Makefile is fancy because I opened Cursor for fun. You guessed it

## Download

We made a launcher to launch Redrose in QEMU. To run it, paste this into your terminal:
```bash
curl -sSSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redroselinux/redroselinux/refs/heads/main/src/redrose-launcher/main.py | python3
```

This uses the latest **release**.

Otherwise, download from the Releases tab.

## Hardware Requirements

The installer can run on a potato, litterally, it needs ~131.200005M RAM. I did not do any tests for CPU.

## Development

When compiling, the Makefile copies your system libraries. You need to build them yourself if you do not want the system ones.

### nightly
To compile the nightly version, clone `mostypc123/redroselinux` and compile:

```
make
```

### stable
*this repo uses busybox. **the linuxImage file is here solely for the CI***. This will be moved to the `car-coreutils-repo` and downloaded in the `Makefile`.

To build Redrose Linux, first build a Linux kernel.
- clone the source
- `make defconfig`
- `make -j$(nproc)`
- move the generated kernel image to ./linuxImage.
- this repo has a precompiled kernel image FOR THE CI.

**You can use the prebuilt**, but it is recommended to build it for yourself. On my PC with 12 cores, it takes about 3 minutes.

Now in the Redrose directory, run:

```
make
```

This does all the magic, and even runs it in a VM.
